# graphql-filmquery

A simple app that fetches film info from a GraphQL [server](https://play.dgraph.io/graphql) as per user input and renders them in the UI.

## Tools used
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) as GraphQL client
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for the UI.
